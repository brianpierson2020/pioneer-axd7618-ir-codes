# IR codes from Pioneer AXD7618 remote

## General
This IR codes are extracted from the Pioneer AXD7618 remote (as shown on the photo below). I have tested them succesfully with a Pioneer VSX-322 but this codes should be compatible with Pioneer VSX-322, VSX-500-K, VSX-522, VSX-528-S, VSX-1122 and possibly other Home Theater Systems from Pioneer as well.

## Used hardware/software
On 29 April 2020, I have extracted these 50 IR codes using the BroadLink Universal Remote (RM mini 3) hardware in combination with [brianpierson2020/broadlinkgo-docker](https://github.com/brianpierson2020/broadlinkgo-docker) software. The remote used is of the type Pioneer AXD7618 and the receiver tested with is Pioneer VSX-322.

_If you also own a BroadLink Universal Remote, the files from the command folder can be imported into the local `commands` folder of the [brianpierson2020/broadlinkgo](https://github.com/rob121/broadlinkgo) or [brianpierson2020/broadlinkgo-docker](https://github.com/brianpierson2020/broadlinkgo-docker) software._

## Conversion
The codes can also probably be converted for use with other hardware/software and to other file formats using software like [IrScrutinizer](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/IrScrutinizer) or [MakeHex](https://github.com/probonopd/MakeHex) but I didn't try that yet. _If you do, please send a PR so we can keep it all in one place._
